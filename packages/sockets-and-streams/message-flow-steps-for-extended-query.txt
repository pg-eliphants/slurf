Parse Message ->
   <- ParseComplete
   <- ErrorResponse

                  <- ParameterDescription (parameters needed by the sattement)
                  <- RowDescription | NoData | ErrorResponse

		Note for Describe (statement varian) Note that since Bind has not yet been issued, the formats to be used for returned columns are not yet known to the backend; the format code fields in the RowDescription message will be zeroes in this case.
